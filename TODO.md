# TODOS

## Add simple home/landing page ✅

For now this will be super simple, nothing fancy - no sliders, textual content, etc.

The homepage should contain no more than the following:

- Application title (TBD)
- Design new application button

## Apply | Section Forms

- Properly handle validations for required fields
- Prevent submission of applciation on validation failure
- Submission failed message alert

## Section Designer

- Add ability to edit section (title, details)

## Application Overview/Designer

- Add ability to edit application (title, details)
- Publish feature - an application should not be accessible by anyone until it has been published. Upon publishing a quik link (public link) will be generated and the user can then share this link across any medium.

## Form Inputs

Finalize and ensure proper functionality (backend) of initial inputs:

- DatePicker ✅
- NumberInput ✅
- TextInput ✅
- UploadInput (photo & docs) ✅
- Checkbox ✅
- Radio ✅
- Signature

## Email input modal ✅

When someone visits a quik link, before they can submit their application we want to show
a popup modal that will ask them for their email address. This is optional and the email collected
will be used to email them a copy of their submitted application. (pdf, file attachments)
